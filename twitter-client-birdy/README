To get this example to run you will need to pip in the 'birdy' package
and create a conf.cfg file in the same directory. The config file will
need two sections formatted as so.
[consumer]
key = {consumer/api key}
secret = {sonsumer/api secret}

[access]
token = {access token}
secret = {access token secret}
